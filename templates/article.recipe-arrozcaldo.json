I am lucky that both my parents are exceptional home cooks - likely where my love of cooking comes from. <\/p><p>Whenever we were sick or when Winter struck, Arroz Caldo was usually simmering away on the stove. Arroz Caldo \"hot rice\", its namesake influenced by years of Spanish regime in the Philippines, is a rice porridge very similar to Chinese Congee. It is important that you use a good <a href=\"\/blogs\/seasonal-journal\/bone-broth\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bone Broth\">broth<\/a>, as it is what makes this dish. Arroz Caldo is usually  topped with shredded chicken, scallions, and lots of fried garlic. Having this always reminds me of home.<\/p><p>This is adaptable based on your taste. Always taste your food throughout the cooking process (make sure food is cooked through before tasting!) and make adjustments as needed. This is generally an <em>EASY<\/em> cooking level dish, it just takes time\/love if you make the broth. Store-bought broth is fine in a pinch, but we love it slow and homemade!<\/p>"
