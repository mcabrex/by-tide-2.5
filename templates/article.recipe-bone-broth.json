It is the base of many soups and stews and meals in general. It is also a sipping broth at night to help wind down and a constant freezer staple. <\/p><p>This recipe can easily be a vegetarian herbal broth by omitting the meat\/bones and adding alot more veggies\/herbs. In fact, everything is adaptable to your taste - use as much or as little of any ingredient and if you only have a few of the pantry herbs, it is okay too! A nourishing broth can still be made with a few ingredients you already have on hand.<\/p>"
